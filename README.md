Description

This course teaches students to apply advanced machine learning techniques to big data sets. Students will learn how to apply both new and previously studied techniques to large data sets in a distributed computing environment. In particular, the course will make use of the Hadoop framework and the Mahout implementation of machine learning algorithms. Students will also learn to apply basic text mining techniques as well as how to implement a basic recommender system in Hadoop.
